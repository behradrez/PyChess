# PyChess
Classic chess written in python with the pygame library.
Game is fully functional, but not its prettiest just yet!
Fun for the whole family. Rated PG and up.

-------------------HOW TO RUN-------------------
1. Download all files into one directory
2. Be sure to have installed the pygame library
3. Run Game.py
4. Pieces can be replaced with any image, simply rename any .png file to the corresponding name
5. Enjoy
------------------------------------------------

All controls are by mouse

This is a small project I put together quickly over a weekend during a trip. The features are limited and the code is inefficient. I'll 
be working on improving it over time.

-------------------COMING SOON-------------------
1. Move History : See all your past moves in either text form or by going back in time and moving pieces back one by one
2. Timer : Make the game more stressful. Timer counts down how much time you spend making a move, with the player losing if the clock hits zero
3. Better (Customizable) UI : Get rid of this godforsaken interface
4. Points and sounds : Self-explanatory
